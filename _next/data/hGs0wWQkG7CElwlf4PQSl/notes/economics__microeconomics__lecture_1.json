The ones willing to pay will get the iPod. The ones who're not willing to pay the amount will not get the iPod.</li>\n<li>Prices determine what to produce, how to produce, and who gets what is produced.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are some places where this does not apply.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Lines for tickets to a concert.</li>\n<li>If prices determine everything then there should be no lines.</li>\n<li>Those willing to pay should get the ticket, those not willing to pay should not get the ticket, why should there be a line?</li>\n<li>(*we'll come to the <em>taste</em> issue later.)</li>\n<li>Perfect world: auction of tickets.</li>\n<li>Evolution towards the economic model (from 30 years ago).\n<ul>\n<li>Price mechanism has replaced the Line mechanism.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theoretical vs. Emprical economics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theretical economics: Building models to describe the world.</li>\n<li>Empirical economics: Testing models to see if it describes the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Positive vs. Normative economics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positive: the way things are.</li>\n<li>Normative: the way things should be.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Example: Auctions on eBay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Textbook example of perfectly competitive market.</li>\n<li>A number of Producers offer to wide range of consumers.</li>\n<li>Consumers bid up the price until the person who has the highest value for the good gets it.</li>\n<li>Recent controversial example: Someone auctioned their kidney on eBay.</li>\n<li>Starting price $25k USD, got to $5M before eBay shut it down.</li>\n<li>Positive question: why did the price go so high?\n<ul>\n<li>Next lecture: Twin forces of Supply and Demand.</li>\n<li>More demand, low supply -> High price.</li>\n<li>Adam Smith introduced this framework (supply and demand)\n<ul>\n<li>Water Diamond paradox.</li>\n<li>Diamond is irrelevant to life and water is most important for life, yet diamond are astronomically expensive and yet water is free.</li>\n<li>Demand for water is higher but supply is much higher.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Demand for kidney: you die without it, so you can spend all your wealth.</li>\n<li>Supplly: very low.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Normative question: <strong>Should this sale have been allowed?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people die waiting for a transplant.</li>\n<li>If someone is very rich, why shouldn't they be allowed to buy it from me? If the transaction makes both parties better off?</li>\n<li>Arguments against this sale?\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Substitution</strong>: Who really needs it more? Poor person who might be in a severe condition, Rich person might just be a kidney collector. (lol)\n<ul>\n<li>Eg. Mickey Mantle: baseball player, raging alcoholic, jumped the queue, got liver transplant, kept drinking and died anyways.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Bad decision?</strong> May encourage illegal ways of getting kidneys?\n<ul>\n<li>We don't trust people to make good decisions when money's involved.\n<ul>\n<li>Someone may sell it anyway without thinking through the risks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Unfairness, Equity:</strong> As a society we may feel it is unfair that rich people get things poor people can't. We value <strong>equality</strong>. Consider at the end of the semester.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tax cuts for rich people? (Normative question.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Microeconomics presents a framework for making decisions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even non economic decisions.</li>\n<li>Example: <em>Whether or not to buy the new version of the textbook?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>First thing to consider: <strong>Preferences</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk-averse or risk-loving</strong>? (buy old edition and take a risk?)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Second factor: <strong>Constraint</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>How much money you have?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Third factor: information from the <strong>Market</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>How much is the price difference?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Solve the constraint optimisation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Example: <em>Should I bring an umbrella?</em></li>\n<li><strong>As if</strong> principle. People may not solve the constraint optimisation problem directly but they behave <em>as if</em> they do.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"},"allNotesIndex":{"base_name":"notes","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes","notes_data":[{"id":"quotes","metadata":{"title":"Quotes","date":"2023-03-21"}}],"directories":[{"base_name":"book notes","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/book notes","notes_data":[{"id":"dokkodo","metadata":{"title":"Dokkodo","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"if","metadata":{"title":"\"If\"","date":"2023-03-27"}},{"id":"worry","metadata":{"title":"Worry","date":"2023-03-29"}}],"directories":[{"base_name":"the bhagvad gita","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/book notes/the bhagvad gita","notes_data":[{"id":"chapter_1","metadata":{"title":"Chapter 1","date":"2023-04-06"}},{"id":"chapter_2","metadata":{"title":"Chapter 2","date":"2023-04-08"}},{"id":"index","metadata":{"title":"The Bhagvad Gita","date":"2023-04-06"}}],"directories":[]}]},{"base_name":"economics","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/economics","notes_data":[],"directories":[{"base_name":"microeconomics","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/economics/microeconomics","notes_data":[{"id":"index","metadata":{"title":"Principles of Microeconomics","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_1","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 1","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_2","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 2","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_3","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 3","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_4","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 4","date":"2023-04-01"}},{"id":"lecture_5","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 5","date":"2023-04-01"}},{"id":"lecture_6","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 6","date":"2023-04-01"}}],"directories":[]}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
