Weigh its merits with unclouded judgement and you will make the right choice when the time comes.</li>\n<li><strong>Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.</strong> - If you only focus on yourself, you'll miss the wonder and knowledge that the whole world has to offer.</li>\n<li><strong>Be Detached from Desire your whole life long.</strong> - Rather than chase things you don't need, take a step back to enjoy what you have.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not regret what you have not done.</strong> - Who you are today, is not who you were yesterday, nor who you will be tomorrow. Move on and work to become better than you were before.</li>\n<li><strong>Never be jealous.</strong> - Rather than covet what others have, be grateful for the blessings you've already been given.</li>\n<li><strong>Never let yourself be saddened by a seperation.</strong> - Loss is a part of life. Redirect your pain into hard work and continue fulfilling your destiny.</li>\n<li><strong>Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor for others.</strong> - Do not spend your whole life blaming others for your failures. Take responsibility for your actions and continue working towards your success.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not let yourself be guided by the feelings of Lust or Love</strong>. - When love is right, you won't have to chase it. It will come to you.</li>\n<li><strong>In all things, have no preferences.</strong> - Be unbaised, open to learn from everyone and everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Be indifferent to where you live.</strong> - <em>It is not where you live that matters, but how you live.</em> If you value your home and the possessions within it, then the things you own end up owning you.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not pursue the taste of good food.</strong> Overindulgence of good food is neither good for your mind nor your body. Practice moderation in all things, but especially in how you eat.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not hold on to possessions that you no longer need.</strong> - Gift your posessions to others who need it more than you.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not act following customary beliefs.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Do not collect weapons and practice with weapons beyond what is useful.</strong> - Your time is precious, spend it wisely.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not fear death.</strong> - \"Death smiles at us all, all we can do is smile back\"</li>\n<li><strong>Do not seek to posess either goods or feifs for your old age.</strong> - Your posessions are of the earth and serve no purpose after you're gone.</li>\n<li><strong>Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You may abandon your body but you must preserve your honor.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Never Stray from the Way.</strong> - Be unshakeable from the set of principles by which you live your life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/musashi.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>"},"allNotesIndex":{"base_name":"notes","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes","notes_data":[{"id":"quotes","metadata":{"title":"Quotes","date":"2023-03-21"}}],"directories":[{"base_name":"book notes","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/book notes","notes_data":[{"id":"dokkodo","metadata":{"title":"Dokkodo","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"if","metadata":{"title":"\"If\"","date":"2023-03-27"}},{"id":"worry","metadata":{"title":"Worry","date":"2023-03-29"}}],"directories":[{"base_name":"the bhagvad gita","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/book notes/the bhagvad gita","notes_data":[{"id":"chapter_1","metadata":{"title":"Chapter 1","date":"2023-04-06"}},{"id":"chapter_2","metadata":{"title":"Chapter 2","date":"2023-04-08"}},{"id":"index","metadata":{"title":"The Bhagvad Gita","date":"2023-04-06"}}],"directories":[]}]},{"base_name":"economics","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/economics","notes_data":[],"directories":[{"base_name":"microeconomics","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/economics/microeconomics","notes_data":[{"id":"index","metadata":{"title":"Principles of Microeconomics","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_1","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 1","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_2","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 2","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_3","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 3","date":"2023-03-23"}},{"id":"lecture_4","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 4","date":"2023-04-01"}},{"id":"lecture_5","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 5","date":"2023-04-01"}},{"id":"lecture_6","metadata":{"title":"Lecture 6","date":"2023-04-01"}}],"directories":[]}]},{"base_name":"machine learning","full_path":"/home/runner/work/krkartikay.github.io/krkartikay.github.io/notes/machine learning","notes_data":[{"id":"cpp-grad","metadata":{"title":"cpp-grad","date":"2023-04-17"}},{"id":"interview-gpt3","metadata":{"title":"Interview with GPT-3.5","date":"2023-04-21"}},{"id":"interview-gpt4","metadata":{"title":"Interview with GPT-4","date":"2023-04-21"}},{"id":"karpathy-lectures","metadata":{"title":"Andrey Karpathy's Lectures","date":"2023-05-14"}}],"directories":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
