## MIT OCW 14.01SC L1 - Introduction to Microeconomics

[MIT OCW 14.01SC - Lec 1 (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vss3nofHpZI&list=PL61533C166E8B0028&index=1)

- Economics is about scarcity, tradeoffs, resouce optimsation.
  - It is called the *'Dismal science'*.
  - Fun because engineering is about resource optimsation.
  - Modern microeconomics founded by Paul Samuelson (at MIT) by introducing math to economics.

- Two types of actors: Consumers and Producers
  - Build models of their behaviour.
  - Model: relations between two variables.
    - Not precise, but general tendencies in the data.
    - Simplifying assumptions.

- Consumer:
  - Utility maximisation subject to Budget constraint.
- Firms:
  - Maximise profit.
  - Subject to demands of consumers and input costs.

- Three fundamental questions of microeconomics.
  - What goods and services should be produced?
  - How to produce those goods and services?
  - Who gets those goods and services?
  - All three questions solved by one key state variable: Prices.

- Example: development of the iPod.
  - Would consumers would be willing to spend money to buy iPod and give up other things?
  - Firm gets a signal that consumers are willing to pay an amount of money to buy an iPod.
  - Firm needs to look at the price to produce the iPod.
  - How to make the iPod will depend on the prices the firms have to pay for the chips, metal, etc.
  - Who gets the iPod? The ones willing to pay will get the iPod. The ones who're not willing to pay the amount will not get the iPod. 
  - Prices determine what to produce, how to produce, and who gets what is produced.

- There are some places where this does not apply.
  - E.g. Lines for tickets to a concert.
  - If prices determine everything then there should be no lines.
  - Those willing to pay should get the ticket, those not willing to pay should not get the ticket, why should there be a line?
  - (*we'll come to the _taste_ issue later.)
  - Perfect world: auction of tickets.
  - Evolution towards the economic model (from 30 years ago).
    - Price mechanism has replaced the Line mechanism.

- Theoretical vs. Emprical economics.
  - Theretical economics: Building models to describe the world.
  - Empirical economics: Testing models to see if it describes the world.

- Positive vs. Normative economics.
  - Positive: the way things are.
  - Normative: the way things should be.

- Example: Auctions on eBay.
  - Textbook example of perfectly competitive market.
  - A number of Producers offer to wide range of consumers.
  - Consumers bid up the price until the person who has the highest value for the good gets it.
  - Recent controversial example: Someone auctioned their kidney on eBay.
  - Starting price $25k USD, got to $5M before eBay shut it down.
  - Positive question: why did the price go so high?
    - Next lecture: Twin forces of Supply and Demand.
    - More demand, low supply -> High price.
    - Adam Smith introduced this framework (supply and demand)
      - Water Diamond paradox.
      - Diamond is irrelevant to life and water is most important for life, yet diamond are astronomically expensive and yet water is free.
      - Demand for water is higher but supply is much higher.
    - Demand for kidney: you die without it, so you can spend all your wealth.
    - Supplly: very low.
  - Normative question: **Should this sale have been allowed?**
    - Many people die waiting for a transplant.
    - If someone is very rich, why shouldn't they be allowed to buy it from me? If the transaction makes both parties better off?
    - Arguments against this sale?
      - **Substitution**: Who really needs it more? Poor person who might be in a severe condition, Rich person might just be a kidney collector. (lol)
        - Eg. Mickey Mantle: baseball player, raging alcoholic, jumped the queue, got liver transplant, kept drinking and died anyways.
      - **Bad decision?** May encourage illegal ways of getting kidneys? 
        - We don't trust people to make good decisions when money's involved.
          - Someone may sell it anyway without thinking through the risks.
      - **Unfairness, Equity:** As a society we may feel it is unfair that rich people get things poor people can't. We value **equality**. Consider at the end of the semester.
    - Tax cuts for rich people? (Normative question.)

- Microeconomics presents a framework for making decisions.
  - Even non economic decisions.
  - Example: *Whether or not to buy the new version of the textbook?*
    - First thing to consider: **Preferences**.
      - **Risk-averse or risk-loving**? (buy old edition and take a risk?)
    - Second factor: **Constraint**.
      - How much money you have?
    - Third factor: information from the **Market**.
      - How much is the price difference?
    - Solve the constraint optimisation.
  - Example: *Should I bring an umbrella?*
  - **As if** principle. People may not solve the constraint optimisation problem directly but they behave *as if* they do.
