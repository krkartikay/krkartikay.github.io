- Assuming for now (till 3rd lecture from the end) that income = budget. (No savings.)
  - Good enough assumption for typical Americans.
- Assume income `y` given to us at the starting which we have to spend on pizza and movies.
- `y = Price_m * No of Movies + Price_p * No of Pizzas` (`y = Sum (P_i * X_i)`)
- Straight Line on the Pizza - Movie Graph (Budget Line)
  ![Two budget lines](/notes/econ-budget-constraint.png)
  - Slope of the line will be (-ve of price ratio) (`-P_m/P_p`)
  - This slope is called **Marginal Rate of Transformation**
- Opportunity Cost
  - Oppertunity cost is the value of the forgone alternative.
  - E.g. A movie is costing us half a pizza. (In the example in the graph, BC_1)
- Maximising Utility subject to Budget Constraint
  ![Indifference curves and budget line](/notes/econ-budget-and-indifference-curves.png)
  - Maximising Utility is equivalent to choosing furthest out indifference curve on the budget line.
  - Indifference curve will be **tangent** to the budget constraint!
  - The slope of the indifference curve = slope of the budget constraint!
  - Marginal rate of substitution = Marginal rate of transformation!
  - `- (∂U/∂x_1) / (∂U/∂x_2) = - P_1 / P_2`
  - This equation is basically saying `(Marginal) Benefit = (Marginal) Costs` (Of next pizza vs movie, etc.)
  - `(∂U/∂x_1)/P_1 = (∂U/∂x_2)/P_2`
  - Benefit of Next dollar on pizza expenditure = Benefit of Next dollar on movie expenditure
  - If that is not true, (let's say next dollar on pizza expenditure buys us more utility) then we can shift our optimum point towards pizza!
  - Corner solutions possible where the slopes will not be equal!
  ![Optimal point with 6 pizzas and 0 movies](/notes/econ-budget-corner-solution.png)
- Mental accounting
  - We solved the above case for only 2 things but in practice we may have more choices -> multidimensional graph
  - Or we can divide things into pairs!
  - Could divide budget into categories and solve for each category.
- Govt policy:
  - If they wanted to lower pizza consumption (pizza causes obesity or whatever), they could tax pizza.
  - Higher price of pizza, flatter budget constraint line -> shifted optimal point, lower consumption of pizza.
  - They could also do something different, like *change the way people think about pizza*.
    - Think of pizza as entertainment, not food. -> Maybe people allocate less to entertainment -> Leads to lower consumption of pizza.
    - Called a **Nudge** in Behavioural Economics.
