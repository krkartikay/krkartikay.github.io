## MIT OCW 14.01SC L2 - Application of Supply and Demand

[MIT OCW 14.01SC - Lec 2 (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFIB8-30YhA&list=PL61533C166E8B0028&index=2)

- Supply and Demand
  - Demand `Q_d = D(P)`
    ![demand curve (price vs qty) sloping downward](/notes/econ-demand-curve.png)
    - `dQ_d / dP < 0`
    - Demand curve may shift due to changes in variables other than price.
    - Market demand is equal to sum of consumer demand.
      - `Q_m = \sum Q_i`
  - Supply `Q_s = S(P)`
    ![supply curve (price vs qty) sloping upward](/notes/econ-supply-curve.png)
    - `dQ_s / dP > 0`
    - Also influenced by other variables, like input costs, technology.
  - Market Equlibrium
    - `Q_d (P*) = Q_s (P*)`
    - `P*` is optimal price.

- Equilibrium shocks
  - What happens when you change the equilibrium (through supply or demand shock)?
  - Understand every concept on three levels: intuitive, graphical, mathematical.
  - Example 1. Price of **substitute product** increases, demand for good also increases. Demand curve shifts up (outward). There is new eqm.
    - Initially: Excess demand.
    - Slide up the supply curve to higher price at new eqm.
    - General eqm: Markets may affect prices in other markets. Feedback effect where it affects the original price. (not in scope within this course).
    ![demand curve shifts upwards and creates new eqm](/notes/econ-demand-shift.png)
  - Where does supply curve come from? **Producer theory** - discussed later. (from firms trying to maximise their profits).
  - Example 2. Price of producing good increases. Supply curve shifts upward (inward).
    - Less ability to produce at the same price. Reduced supply.
    - New eqm at higher price.
  - In both situations (increased demand and decreased supply), the same thing happened! The price went up.
    - From looking at the price alone it is not possible to tell which of these happened.
    - However the volume was affected differently, in one the qty went up, in other qty went down.

- Government Intervention
  - Example: Minimum wage
  - Consider market for Labour
    - Labour is an input to the production process
    - Firms demand labour, People supply labour. (flipped wrt. previous example of goods)
      ![Min wage line above eqm](/notes/econ-min-wage.png)
    - At wage `W_` (above `W*`), workers are delighted to work `L_s` hours, but firms need only `L_d` hours.
      - Excess supply.
      - Under perfectly competitive market conditions -> excess supply would cause demand to increase and wages would fall.
      - But you can't do that now because of the govt.
      - We call the excess supply **'unemployment'**.
      - Disequilibrium -> market condition still exists at `(L_d, W_)` -> determined by constraint.
  - Example 2: Gas price ceiling.
    - Price capped at `p1`, eqm was at `p2`.
    - Excess demand now. Eqm shifts to new point with lower qty being supplied at lower price.
      ![Gasoline cap ceiling price below eqm](/notes/econ-price-ceil.png)
  - Markets are robust and will do whatever they can to restore equilibrium!
  - Welfare economics of this restriction?
    - Costs:
      - **Efficiency loss**: A trade that could have made both parties better off is not made.
      - **Allocation inefficiency**: Lines at the gas station. Gas shortage. (Hoarding?)
    - Benefit:
      - **Equity**: Fairness
    - **Direct effects** (what voters see) and **indirect effects** (what economists see).
    - **Equity-Efficiency tradeoffs**.
    - **Secondary markets** can arise to evade government regulation.
