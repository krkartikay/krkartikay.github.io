title: 'ML Study plan'

It's 2024, I'm trying to self-study ML, but I don't really have a plan!

There is no standardised way of going through ML and showing results so far... I guess.
Except for a few courses which I've already watched but I don't have anything to show for it.

The problem is, I haven't made any projects so far. I need to complete exercises,
build stuff and show results!

I'll try to find stuff to do in proper order and note everything down here.

### The obvious stuff

1. Basic Machine Learning (Andrew Ng) - Done.
2. MIT OCW Deep learning (Youtube) - Done.
3. Deepmind x UCL Deep learning (Youtube) - In progress.
