## Dokkodo - The Path of Aloneness
### by [Miyamoto Musashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi)

1. **Accept everything just the way it is.** - rather than wish for a life without suffering, look for the strength to suffer well and overcome it.
2. **Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.** - Suffer Today and live Tomorrow as a King among Men.
3. **Do not, under any circumstances, depend upon a partial feeling.** - Take your time to consider an important decision. Weigh its merits with unclouded judgement and you will make the right choice when the time comes.
4. **Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.** - If you only focus on yourself, you'll miss the wonder and knowledge that the whole world has to offer.
5. **Be Detached from Desire your whole life long.** - Rather than chase things you don't need, take a step back to enjoy what you have.
6. **Do not regret what you have not done.** - Who you are today, is not who you were yesterday, nor who you will be tomorrow. Move on and work to become better than you were before.
7. **Never be jealous.** - Rather than covet what others have, be grateful for the blessings you've already been given.
8. **Never let yourself be saddened by a seperation.** - Loss is a part of life. Redirect your pain into hard work and continue fulfilling your destiny.
9. **Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor for others.** - Do not spend your whole life blaming others for your failures. Take responsibility for your actions and continue working towards your success.
10. **Do not let yourself be guided by the feelings of Lust or Love**. - When love is right, you won't have to chase it. It will come to you.
11. **In all things, have no preferences.** - Be unbaised, open to learn from everyone and everything.  
12. **Be indifferent to where you live.** - *It is not where you live that matters, but how you live.* If you value your home and the possessions within it, then the things you own end up owning you.
13. **Do not pursue the taste of good food.** Overindulgence of good food is neither good for your mind nor your body. Practice moderation in all things, but especially in how you eat.
14. **Do not hold on to possessions that you no longer need.** - Gift your posessions to others who need it more than you.
15. **Do not act following customary beliefs.**
16. **Do not collect weapons and practice with weapons beyond what is useful.** - Your time is precious, spend it wisely.
17. **Do not fear death.** - "Death smiles at us all, all we can do is smile back"
18. **Do not seek to posess either goods or feifs for your old age.** - Your posessions are of the earth and serve no purpose after you're gone.
19. **Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.**
20. **You may abandon your body but you must preserve your honor.**
21. **Never Stray from the Way.** - Be unshakeable from the set of principles by which you live your life.
